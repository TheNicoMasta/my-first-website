<pre id ='one' > Well today's the day, and i just HAVE to say, I'm so grateful for you.  <br>
 I love your accent, your smile, your gaze, your giggle, your hair, your face, your soul, and I love that you chose me, and i'm forever honored. <br>   
 On this special day i figured that it's time to express how grateful i truly am for you, and I hope that you can see that, cause everything I say here, I mean it. <br>
 I've always loved getting to know you slowly before and always making sure you were incldued just incase you felt down, <br> 
 i never knew my kindness would get your attention in a romantic way, but honestly I have no regret, and YES BABY i know im lucky to have you considering the low chances I had overall. <br>   
 Im grateful for your mother and siblings approving of my exsistence as almost everyday I tell my mother how lucky I am to have your love, and your family's support. <br>
 Lastly, I wish you and your family great fortune forever and ever, just like how our love is gonna be.
